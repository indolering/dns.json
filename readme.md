This is a repo for different JSON

A naive transliteration of the plaintext zone format and binary message protocol would contain seldom used vestigial
 structures and inherit a style designed for B&W 640x480 terminals.  A new JSON standard offers an opportunity to
 update the specification, but how does one chose the "best" corrective action?  The best standards tend to codify
 existing practices (markdown) or are the result of competition (AES, SHA2, etc).  While popularity is not a universal
 indicator of quality, this proposal is informed by a survey of existing DNS REST APIs.
